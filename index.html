				<p>This analysis of Lionel Hampton Houses (Bond Ryder & Associates, 1971-73), a Mitchell-Lama project in Central Harlem considers the ways in which the project's various actors—from the eponymous donor to the architects—had a stake in Harlem's supposed "crisis," and how that impacted the architecture of this housing complex.</p>
