				<p>This project suggests a method for embedding care for laborers into the construction process, which leaves a "residue" that offers care more permanently in post-construction, too. <i>—with Audrey Tseng Fischer</i></p>

				<p>This analysis of Lionel Hampton Houses (Bond Ryder & Associates, 1971-73), a Mitchell-Lama project in Central Harlem, considers the ways in which the project's various actors—from the eponymous donor to the architects—had a stake in Harlem's supposed "crisis," and how that impacted the architecture of this housing complex.</p>

				<p>This project brings the practice of salvage archaeology—the emergency excavation of archaeological sites that fall within the right-of-way of infrastructural construction—to bear on the discourse of settler colonialism in order to situate preservation as key to its epistemology.</p>

				<p>Through a close reading of the pastoral play <i>As You Like It</i>, I suggest that for Shakespeare, a passive nature may never be “natural,” but nature <i>can</i> be an active participant in human life.</p>

				<h3><a href="cumin.html">Abandoning Authenticity: A Closer Look at Cumin</a> <span class="square">■</span></h3>
				<p>It is often spices that give a cuisine its distinct local—and perhaps "authentic"—taste. By taking a closer look at cumin as one such important spice, I suggest that we may rethink what is growable in order to begin building new cuisines.</p>
