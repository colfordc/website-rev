					<h1><b>Give and Take</b></h1>
					<p>North Gallery Exhibition, Yale School of Architecture<br>March 28–April 9, 2022<br><br>Curation: Katie Colford, Clare Fentress, Dilara Karademir<br>Graphic Design: Claire Hungerford, Betty Wang<br></p>
					<p>Eschewing the white-cube presentations that typically occur within architectural contexts, Give and Take—a two-week-long installation at the <a href="https://www.architecture.yale.edu/exhibitions/112-give-and-take">Yale School of Architecture’s North Gallery</a>—is instead a participatory environment. It transforms the North Gallery into a new type of room solely for giving and receiving gifts, positing reciprocity, pleasure, and delight as key aspects of academic and intellectual life. Every School of Architecture student is invited by name to participate, and their engagement shapes the slow unfolding of the room over the course of the installation. By eliding the distinction between curator and visitor, Give and Take quietly challenges the competitive, hierarchical nature of architectural education and offers a counterpoint rooted in feminist praxes and relational aesthetics.</p>

					<p>Shimmering curtains transformed the North Gallery—a student-curated space within the Yale School of Architecture Gallery—into a private room.

					<p>Within the room, namecards for every student at the school hung on rows of shelves. On the first day of the installation, a gift sat in front of each name. Gifts were replenished every day.</p>

					<p>The room was not the only gift-giver. By the third day, the shelves were lined with objects from one student to antoher: notes, poems, marbles, rocks, paper flowers, half-eaten cookies, money, sealed packages, phone numbers—</p>
